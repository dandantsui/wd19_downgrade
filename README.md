# wd19_downgrade
for those who use the Dell WD19/WD19TB/WD19S with macOS and want sound back!


The old WD19 firmware was very hard to find on the internet -- archived here now. 

- Use a Windows laptop with USB-C DisplayPort/TB
- Run command prompt `cmd` and `cd` into the directory your file is located
- run the command (the file name) `DellDockingStationFwUp_01.00.21_07222021_WD19.exe /f` the /f is very important!
- Run the update and it will force the update to the WD19
- Enjoy working audio again on your front headphone port!
